# The Walking dead - Escape the bunker. (Hangman Concept)
This is my first project attempting to create a game only using javaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Outline
This game is based off the famous tv show `The Walking Dead` and incorporates a hangman style game with a decoding twist to it. The game takes 2 puzzles and mashes them together to create a hangman style game where you need to find `TWD` themed words that fit in the spaces shown. 
Twist: You will be given the word as the clue but it will appear in a Caesar cypher.
Each time you guess the wrong letter, a zombie will appear. If you are overtaken by seven zombies before you get the right word, you will become part of the walking dead(you lose!)! *This game might seem simple but its going to be a little more complicated because we will be using using a caesars cypher code for our choosen word.
## The-Opening
The page will open up with a animated gif of the walking dead which is centered in text that asks if you are willing to play the game to make it out alive.

There will be 2 butoons to enter into the game, one that says Yes, and one that says No.


## Description
Once you have clicked yes, the next thing that will appear is a description and a short walk through of the game and how to play it. 
The intro will state that you are locked inside a bunker and there are walkers(zombies) all around you and they are getting closer.
 The zombies will continue going towards you and the only way to escape the bunker is to figure out the passcode. You must be careful because each time you make a mistake more zombies will continue to surround you. (There is only enough room for 6 zombies before you are overtaken!)

## Ideas
This section will be a brainstorming section on anytypes of functions or code I can think of off the top of my head.
Caesar's Cypher: 

1. Because the hardest part of this project is the functionality, my plan is to start with simple functions that will iterate through an array of words and return a random word.
Create an array full of words that are associated with the walking dead as our word bank.

2. The decoder aspect will be set up with a ceaser cypher(after doing some research, I have found how to write a statement that iterates through a string and is able to find where that iteration is on another string with equal letters and pull that letter out. 

3. I will be spending more time during the week on my functions and how to get the base layer of the game to work.
